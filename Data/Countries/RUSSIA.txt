The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Russia on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese citizens in Tyumen, Siberia and Chita, Russian Far East tested positive for the virus, with both cases being contained. Early prevention measures included restricting the border with China and extensive testing. The infection spread from Italy on 2 March, leading to additional measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres, and museums, as well as shutting the border and declaring a non-working period which lasted up to 11 May, having been extended twice. By the end of March, lockdowns were imposed in the vast majority of federal subjects, including Moscow. By 17 April, cases were confirmed in all federal subjects. On 27 April, the number of confirmed cases surpassed those in China.

Russia has become the country with the third-most cases in the world, after the United States and Brazil.
